Geo Notes
=========

**Geo Notes** is an HTML5 offline-capable, geo-aware (*add any buzzword here*) mobile web application built using web standards and awesome javascript libraries like Backbone.js or jQuery Mobile.

We build it in three parts (labs at Télécom Saint-Etienne) :

+ In this first part, we take a look at the final project, organize our development environment, and then begin work on the Mobile UI.
+ In the second part of the project, we continue to build our HTML5 mobile note taking application and learn how to use Backbone.js to manage the data in our application (the Model layer).
+ In the final part, we build the Geolocation feature for our note-taking application.
